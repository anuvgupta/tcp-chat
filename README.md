# tcp-chat
TCP chat room server with basic client, accessible via telnet. Built with Node.js.  

## features

Clients can:

-   Connect via `telnet` or other TCP clients
-   Send text messages to all clients
-   Send commands to the server
-   Choose a display name using commands

The server holds up to 10 messages in history, which are forwarded to new clients upon connecting.

### client commands

Commands can be invoked with `:cmd` syntax.  
Arguments are passed space-separated after the command name, as `:cmd {arg1} {arg2} {arg3}`.  
Available commands:

-   `:name {name}` – set name (alias n)
    -   Your name (or `anonymous`, if unset) will prefix your messages
-   `:quit` – leave chat (alias q)
-   `:help` – list commands (h)

## usage

Requires latest `node`, but no packages.  
Run with `node chat {port}` (or `npm test` for testing).  
Clients can connect with telnet: `telnet localhost {port}`.

## live

Connect to the hosted server: `telnet tcp.anuv.me 3004`.
